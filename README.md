# SQL-POWER-BI-PROJECT-OF-OLA
Analyzed OLA ride booking data using SQL and Power BI to uncover insights on bookings, cancellations, revenue, and ride trends. Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs and filters to support data-driven decision-making and demonstrate practical data analytics and business intelligence skills

## Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to analyze OLA ride booking data using SQL and Power BI to identify booking trends, cancellation patterns, revenue performance, and ride behavior. The project aims to transform raw data into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards to support data-driven business decision-making.

## Insights

The majority of OLA bookings resulted in completed rides, indicating consistent customer demand.
Cancellations occurred due to both users and drivers, with certain time periods showing higher frequency.
Revenue was largely generated from completed rides with medium to high booking values.
Peak booking hours revealed clear demand patterns useful for operational planning.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. By converting raw booking data into interactive dashboards, the analysis supports data-driven decision-making and highlights key performance trends in OLA ride operations.
